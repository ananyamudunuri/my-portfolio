      <p>
        I’m Ananya—part builder, part optimizer. I love turning messy data into fast,
        dependable systems and shipping products that actually get used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Informal bits: I tinker with AI art (comics!), obsess over clean tooling,
        and believe great data infra should feel invisible. Outside work, I’m into
        ramen hunts, sketching, and helping friends debug anything—from SQL joins
        to why their Wi-Fi hates them.
